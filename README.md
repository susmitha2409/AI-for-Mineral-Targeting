AI for Mineral Targeting â€“ IndiaAI Hackathon 2025

This repository is built as part of the IndiaAI Hackathon focused on applying artificial intelligence for mineral discovery and exploration. The project uses a combination of:

    Geospatial data (faults, lineaments, shear zones, etc.)

    Grid-based spatial analysis

    Machine learning models for predictive mineral targeting

    Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and model evaluation

  Objective: Identify and prioritize zones with high mineral potential using AI/ML techniques, enabling smarter and faster decision-making in mineral exploration.

  Technologies used: Python, GeoPandas, Scikit-learn, PCA, Matplotlib, Contextily, and other open geospatial tools.
